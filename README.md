Joint_Design_Improvement
This project focuses on redesigning the joint shown in the attached images, aiming to achieve higher durability and structural strength while maintaining the provided key dimensions.

Task_Description:

The goal is to enhance the joint’s design by optimizing its geometry for better load resistance and durability. Critical dimensions such as the base diameter (Ø45 mm), overall width (54 mm), and height (29 mm) must be considered and respected.

Work_Process:

Each redesigned version must be submitted with an FEA (Finite Element Analysis) simulation report to test its performance under realistic loads. Designs will be reviewed and compared to the original version during the next meeting.

Project_Requirements:

• CAD software (e.g., SolidWorks)
• FEA simulation capability
• Clear documentation of design changes and test results
